            <h1>About</h1>
            I am a Computer Science undergraduate in Nanyang Technological University with a strong interest in computing. My projects involve training and fine-tuning AI models with Pytorch and Tensorflow, developing apps with React, Node.js, Next.js, SQL, and AWS, conducting data analysis with Python and Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab, as well as designing database systems with SQL. During my projects I have developed a passion in developing apps to improve the user experience, creating robust data storage systems, and training AI models with complex algorithms. I would love to discuss how my skills can support your company.
